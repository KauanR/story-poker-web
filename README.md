## About
Story Poker is a web application that provides a "Planing Poker" platform based on the Scrum methodology. It basically allows users to simultaneously vote on the time/effort required to complete each product implementation. It is used in conjunction with its back-end, the [Story Poker API](https://github.com/DouglasAndre25/story-poker-api).
